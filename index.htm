		<h1>Charles's Portfolio</h1>
		<p>My name is Charles Prinslow. I graduated in June of 2016 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a Mathematics minor from <a href="http://www.wou.edu">Western Oregon University</a>. I also have an Associates degree that I graduated with in June of 2014 from <a href="http://www.chemeketa.edu">Chemeketa Community College</a>. I'm currently in an Internship with Elegantra and have been doing it since April of 2018. I'm helping them with building the Joyous app which bring customers and business's closer. I am a quick learner and have a great work ethic.</p>
